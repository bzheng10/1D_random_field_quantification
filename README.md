1. The following code can be used to quantify a non-Gaussian
   non-stationary random process or a 1D non-Gaussian heterogeneous random field using Hermite polynomial chaos.
   The correlation of random process/field is captured by KL expansion.

2. The implemented algorithm can be referred to 
   "Sakamoto, S., Ghanem, R. Polynomial Chaos Decomposition 
   for the Simulation of Non-Gaussian Nonstationary Stochastic Processes. 
   Journal of Engineering Mechanics, 2002". 

3.The Hermite polynomial chaos information are generated by the algorithm 
  developed in another repo "???" which is to be uploaded in to github. 
  
Please feel free to try it. Enjoy!
