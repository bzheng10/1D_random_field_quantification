# Quantification_of_random_process_or_1Dfield_using_Hermite_polynomial_Chaos


Date-Aug21-2018
Note that this following code can be used to quantify a non-Gaussian
non-stationary random process or random field using Hermite polynomial chaos.
The correlation of random process/field is captured by KL expansion.

The implemented algorithm can be referred to 
"Sakamoto, S., Ghanem, R. Polynomial Chaos Decomposition 
for the Simulation of Non-Gaussian Nonstationary Stochastic Processes.
